* Introduction :
    This project focuses on removing the background from images using deep learning techniques. I have leveraged TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a neural network that can accurately separate foreground objects(humans) from the background in various images.

* Installation :
    To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
    - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/background-removal.git
    - cd background-removal
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
